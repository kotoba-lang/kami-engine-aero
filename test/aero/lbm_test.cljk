  "`aero.lbm` shells out to an external `kami-cfd` binary, so these tests
  do not invoke `solve` (no binary is guaranteed to be present, and a
  unit test must not depend on one). They cover the pure decision logic
  around it: the fastback/box vs teardrop/block shape mapping, the
  calibration constants that anchor kami-cfd's raw Cd to the rom-buildup
  reference, and that :lbm is actually registered on the shared
  `cae.solver` contract."
